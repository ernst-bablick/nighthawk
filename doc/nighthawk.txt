INTRODUCTION                                                       *nighthawk*

NightHawk is a plugin for NeoVim on UNIX based operating systems that lets 
the editor track how much time is spend editing individual files.

The plugin exposes Lua functions that accumulate that information for all
files in a directory tree and provide the basis to track the time that was
spend on working in different workspaces or for different projects.

Those and other service functions can be used in other plugins (e.g. Neo-Tree)
to visualize the information or to use it to create project reports or fill
out time cards.

FUNCTIONALITY                                        *nighthawk-functionality*

NightHawk observes activities  of Vim buffers and  as long as the  user is not
idle for a longer  period of time it will accumulate  and remember the editing
time for files that belongs to corresponding buffers.

Time  spend on  buffers that  have no  file attached  (e.g. Neo-Tree,  Tagbar,
Terminal, ...) will also be tracked  and automatically be added to the numbers
of the last file worked on.

Filenames and accumulated work time will be stored in a  SQLite database which
will  preserve  the data  even  if  no  NeoVim  instance is  active.  Multiple
instances of NeoVim will all store the data in one database.

Stored data of the database can be deleted with NeoVim commands  as soon as it
is not required anymore.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                          *nighthawk-installation*

The plugin is available through Github.

    https://github.com/ernst-bablick/nighthawk

It depends on a SQLite/LuaJIT plugin that is also available as plugin for NeoVim

    https://github.com/kkharji/sqlite.lua

Please note that certain plugins require additional installation steps. SQLite
needs access to a library from the SQLite binary package that can be installed 
on MacOS via

    brew install sqlite

For futher details please read the corresponding documentation of the plugin.

Nighthawk logs into  logfile or into the NeoVims messages  buffer if following
plugin is  available in NeoVim and  if logging is also  enabled. Otherwise the
plugin is not required.

    https://github.com/smartpde/debuglog

Either install the plugins manually, use your favorite package manager, or use
Vim's built-in package support.

A configuration for the Lazy plugin manager of NeoVim would look like this:

    {
        'ernst-bablick/nighthawk',
        dependencies = {
            'smartpde/debuglog',
            'kkharji/sqlite.lua',
        },
        config = function ()
            require('nighthawk').setup({
                -- REPLACE THIS LINE BY CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
            })
        end
    }

Please  note  the config-section  at  the  end  of the  plugin  configuration.
In  order  that  Nighthawk can  work  properly  it  is  required to  call  the
setup-function of  the plugin.  This function  accepts the  optional Nighthawk
configuration  where certain  parameters  can be  specified  to overwrite  the
plugins builtin defaults. The next sections shows all supported configuration
parameters, their default settings and allowed values.

    -- configuration of the Database class
    database = {
        -- path that has to end with a slash
        db_directory = "~/.local/share/nvim/nighthawk/",

        -- name of the DB file located in db_directory
        db_file = "Nighthawk.sqlite",
    },
    -- configuration of the Watchdog class
    watchdog = {
        -- Max seconds of inactivity before timer stops 
        -- (number in seconds > report_interval+1)
        max_inactivity = 120,

        -- Reporting interval in milliseconds (numbers >= 1000)
        report_interval = 1000,
    },
