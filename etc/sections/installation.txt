The plugin is available through Github.

    https://github.com/ernst-bablick/nighthawk

It depends on a SQLite/LuaJIT plugin that is also available as plugin for NeoVim

    https://github.com/kkharji/sqlite.lua

Please note that certain plugins require additional installation steps. SQLite
needs access to a library from the SQLite binary package that can be installed 
on MacOS via

    brew install sqlite

For futher details please read the corresponding documentation of the plugin.

Nighthawk logs into  logfile or into the NeoVims messages  buffer if following
plugin is  available in NeoVim and  if logging is also  enabled. Otherwise the
plugin is not required.

    https://github.com/smartpde/debuglog

Either install the plugins manually, use your favorite package manager, or use
Vim's built-in package support.

A configuration for the Lazy plugin manager of NeoVim would look like this:

    {
        'ernst-bablick/nighthawk',
        dependencies = {
            'smartpde/debuglog',
            'kkharji/sqlite.lua',
        },
        config = function ()
            require('nighthawk').setup({
                watchdog = {
                    -- Max seconds of inactivity before timer stops
                    max_inactivity = 120,   

                    -- Reporting interval in milliseconds
                    report_interval = 5000, 
                },
                database = {
                    db_file = "~/Nighthawk.sqlite",
                },
            })
        end
    }

Please  note  the config-section  at  the  end  of the  plugin  configuration.
In  order  that  Nighthawk can  work  properly  it  is  required to  call  the
setup-function of  the plugin.  This function  accepts the  optional Nighthawk
configuration  where certain  parameters  can be  specified  to overwrite  the
plugins builtin defaults.
