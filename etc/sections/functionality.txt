NightHawk observes activities  of Vim buffers and  as long as the  user is not
idle for a longer  period of time it will accumulate  and remember the editing
time for files that belongs to corresponding buffers.

Time  spend on  buffers that  have no  file attached  (e.g. Neo-Tree,  Tagbar,
Terminal, ...) will also be tracked  and automatically be added to the numbers
of the last file worked on.

Filenames and accumulated work time will be stored in a  SQLite database which
will  preserve  the data  even  if  no  NeoVim  instance is  active.  Multiple
instances of NeoVim will all store the data in one database.

Stored data of the database can be deleted with NeoVim commands  as soon as it
is not required anymore.
